### **Welcome!**

I'm a fishery scientist with a background in policy, interested in stakeholder engagement and supporting data limited fisheries. Home base is the [Fay Lab](http://www.smast.umassd.edu/lab_fay/) at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, School for Marine Science and Technology where I am a technical associate and decision support specialist. When I'm not thinking about fish, I might be out sailing or diving (and probably still thinking about fish).

Current projects include:

-   Synthesis of fish habitat and climate vulnerability assessments for the New England and Mid Atlantic Fishery Councils.

-   Supporting stakeholder engagement on CINAR-funded work to evaluate changes to NOAA fishery independent survey data products due to overlap with wind installation and lease areas.

-   Facilitating prototype management strategy evaluation workshops for the New England Fishery Management Council.
